detail = """The _Lua Sandbox_'s RPC mechanism was initially developed using an off the shelf
library for gRPC. This solution seemed like the right choice initially since gRPC provides
a very flexible interface, however the constraints of an embedded linux environment and
using a Unix Domain Socket(UDS) pair as the underlying transport made some parts of gRPC less
than ideal. To replace this solution, I developed a solution initially using 
a UDS pair with datagram semantics which when initially deployed resulted in an average
20% performance gain however we discovered that some of our messaging between parent
and child process was much too large to fit into a reasonably sized datagram and in some
cases was too large for the default OS maximum of 200+ kb. This lead to a second iteration
that used a UDS pair with stream semantics to allow for larger messages. This stream based
implementation used a 4 byte length as a prefix to all messages.
