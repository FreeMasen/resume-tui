long_desc = """As an excuse to learn more about how parsers work in software, I started this project with the 
primary goal of providing a flexible, general purpose suite of libraries for interacting with JavaScript source code.

The project consists of a handful of crates that I've tried to seperate logically to allow user to opt-in to the code
they want to use.
