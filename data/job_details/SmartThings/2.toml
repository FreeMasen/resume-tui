To enable our platform to be as flexible as possible, I developed and performed
maintenance on a sand-boxed execution environment for Lua scripts to interact with smart home
devices. This project used, seccomp, nsjail, runtime checks, and an RPC layer to isolate scripts
from the rest of the product.

The RPC was implemented using gRPC over a unix domain socket where 1 child process was spawned for
each 3rd party script installed by the user. I later refactored the RPC mechanism to use a simpler
system I developed based on unix datagrams sent over anonymous pairs of sockets.
