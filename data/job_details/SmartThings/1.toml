snippet = "Implementing a memory efficient, metrics collector for an embedded linux target"

detail = """To gain additional visibility into the performance of our embedded linux devices
deployed across the world, I developed a system for collecting and reporting metrics for our fleet.

This system was constrained by the needs of the device's relatively low memory and long expected
lifetime, meaning keeping a time series either on disk or in memory was unavailable. To achieve some
level of visibilty, I developed a solution that would allow queries to be sent to devices using
Launch Darkly, once recieved the query would start collecting any metrics events in a low overhead
_report_. This report would then be emitted to our platform's cloud for post-processing.

For counters and gauges, I developed a solution that would calculate the min, max, and average
values on the fly. For histogram events, the _HdrHistogram_ crate provided the calculations with a
wrapper for handling float values in a integer only implementation.
