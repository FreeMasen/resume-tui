detail = """
Build an Actix-Web based HTTP server for local communication and processing of
cloud originated messages on the edge. A service was deployed in the cloud to receive messages
destined for a device on the edge, this service would look up the the device by ID and then
forward the request through a persistent connection.

The device's HTTP server would receive this request, perform authorization of both client and
principal (typically a user) before executing the endpoint and returning a response through the same
persistent connection. This system was developed to be flexible enough to act as an RPC system on a
Tizen/Android based devices as well as the potential for end users to access the interface on the
local area network. The authorization mechanism uses a sequence of attempts to authorize the
principal including local evaluation of a subset of definitions, caching previous authorizations and
a call out to the cloud service that acts as a platform single source of truth.
