based on the [LuaSocket API](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasocket) and uses a polling via
`select` to schedule coroutines. It provides udp, tcp, and tls socket facilities and an MPSC channel
implementation. The Cosock organization includes projects that build upon these primitives to
provide HTTP facilities.
