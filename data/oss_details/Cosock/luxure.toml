long_desc = """This project was my initial entry into the Cosock organization, initially to support
a SmartThings Edge Driver that acts as a virtual smart switch via a locally hosted HTTP server. This
project provides and Express-like API for defining an HTTP server, where a `Server` is
instantiated and provided an IP address, port pair to listen on. Endpoints are defined by calling
methods on the `Server` corresponding to the HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc). Finally the
`Server` can be driven either via `run` which will occupy the whole process or can be driven
manually via `tick` which will accept a single incoming request which allows the server to be
used as a component of a process.
