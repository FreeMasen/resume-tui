As part of an official effort to improve Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at SmartThings
I participated in a formal mentorship program. As part of this program, I was paired with a
junior-level engineer whose goal was to get promoted in the next promotion cycle. To achieve this
goal we worked through some of the ways that they could increase their visibility, track their own
performance, and tell a compelling story about why they deserve to be promoted.
