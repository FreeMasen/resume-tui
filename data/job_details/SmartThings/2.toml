detail = """
To enable our platform to be as flexible as possible, I developed and performed
maintenance on a sand-boxed execution environment for Lua scripts to interact with smart home
devices. This project used seccomp, nsjail, runtime checks, and an RPC layer to isolate scripts
from the rest of the product. 

In this system each script (aka "driver") is executed in its own child process with an anonymous UDS
pair acting as the RPC connection. Protected operations include creating and/or communicating on
TCP/UDP sockets sending, receiving messages from the Zigbee, Thread, and ZWave radios, and
communicating device status to/from our cloud platform.
