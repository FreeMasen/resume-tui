HTTP server implementation called Luxure and a WebSocket implementation called Lustre.

This project provides an abstraction for `HttpMessage`s, which are inherited by the Request and
Response types. These types also share a definition for a `Headers` map. All types can be parsed
from an incoming stream and also generate messages that can be written to outgoing sinks. It
supports 3 schemes for request and response termination, `content-length` encoding, `chunk` encoding
and socket close.
