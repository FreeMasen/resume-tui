# Resume TUI

This project is an attempt to make an interactive resume as a TUI application similar to efforts
like [This 2d animation portfolio](https://github.com/JSLegendDev/2d-portfolio-kaboom).

## How it works

In a build script, the `DATABASE` static variable is generated by parsing a handful of toml files
in a specific directory layout corrisponding to the details of each view. The layout is outlined
below.

### Directory Layout

The default location for this is a `data` directory in the current working directory when building,
this can be overridden by using the `RESUME_DATA_PATH` environment variable.

```text
./data
├── edu.toml
├── info.toml
├── job_details
│   └── <Job Name or Id>
│       ├── bullet-1.toml
│       └── bullet-2.toml
├── jobs.toml
├── oss.toml
└── oss_details
    └── <Project Name or Id>
        ├── subproject-1.toml
        ├── subproject-2.toml
        └── subproject-4.toml
```

#### `info.toml`

The primary entrypoint for the Home page is the `info.toml` file where the base information is
stored; it includes a name and a "tag line".

<details>

<summary>JSON Schema</summary>

```json
{
    "title": "Info",
    "description": "Basic information",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "description": "The name displayed on the Home page.",
            "type": "string",
        },
        "tag_line": {
            "description": "The tagline to display below the name on the Home page.",
            "type": "string"
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

#### `jobs.toml`

This file is the entry point for the professional experience portion of the resume. The top level is
an array of `Job` objects under the key `job` or `jobs` [^1].

<details>

<summary>JSON Schema</summary>

```json
{
    "title": "Jobs",
    "description": "List of job details",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "jobs": {
            "description": "list of jobs",
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "Job"
            },
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

Each `Job` object contains some basic information about the position including company name, title,
start date, optional end date, a list of details and an optional id. The list of details can either
be included directly in the toml file or can be stored in the `job_details` directory. `job_details`
is layed as directories, each directory will be named have either the `company` or `id`. The job
details when in the TOML file should be rendered in the order they are defined and any additional
details in teh `job_details` directory will be appended to this list in the order they are returned
from `read_dir`.

            "type": "string"
        },
        "company": {

            },
        }
    },

#### `oss.toml`

This file is the entry point for the open source work portion of the resume. The top level is
an array of `Project` objects under the key `projects` or `project` [^1].

<details>

<summary>JSON Schema</summary>

```json

    }
}
```

</detail>

A `Project` is a recursive data structure for describing open source contribution it contains a
project name, short description, long description and a list of sub projects. This structure
makes it easier to represent GitHub Organizations and their repositories and/or crates
that have workspace crates that deserve additional details.

[^1]: Because toml allows for 2 array syntaxes, array properties have a serde `alias` to allow
  them to be formatted as either an inline array (`<list-name> = []`) or with the `[[<list-name>]]` syntax. I personally
  find it to be more plesent to use the plural name for the former and non-plural for the latter.
