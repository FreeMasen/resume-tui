community employees are encouraged to collect after hours to share interests. A good example of one
of these groups was a jam session, where musically inclined folks can get together and play music
together. In my time with the company I started a community around Programming Languages where we
would meet monthly to share and discuss different programming languages like Rust, SML, Closure.
